# RPS-JS-3
This was inspired from Dave Gray's refactored rock paper scissors part-2 made only with javascript. 
After going through the tutorial, the game was coded from scratch on my own. 
It helped in practicing if-else statements, ternary operators, while-loops, functions, continue and break statements.
